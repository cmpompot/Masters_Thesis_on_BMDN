# Bayesian Mixture Density Network for Nuclear Fission Prediction
This repository contains the implementation of my Master's Thesis: **"Bayesian Mixture Density Networks for Nuclear Fission Fragment Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification"**.

The project develops a sophisticated neural network that combines Bayesian inference with mixture density modeling to predict nuclear fission fragment distributions while providing robust uncertainty estimates.
